**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals/steps of this project is following:
* Make a pipeline that finds relevant lane lines on the road
* The pipeline can be used for both images and video inputs


Sequence of steps involved in building the pipeline are listed below:
* After reading the image file, converted them to gray scale for efficient computing
* Then applied blurring using gaussian blurring to remove noise from the images
*

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
